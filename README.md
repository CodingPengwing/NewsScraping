# NewsScraping #
This repository contains my solution to project 1 of COMP20008-Elements of Data Processing. 
The aim of the project was to crawl and scrape a given URL, which contains news about sports 
teams, and from there use ML techniques to clean data, present it visually, and analyze the 
presented information.
